# SeniorDesign wifi scan
Team 13: Wenjun Ma and Man Hang Henry Chong


In this miniproject, our goal is to utilize Raspberry Pi to enable us monitoring the number of static or moving wifi nearby. With the function wifi_scan.py and wifi_plot.py, it is relatively easy for us to minitor the number of wifi or hotspot arounding us. Through further interpreting the data output, we are able to get some interesting conclusion such as the number of cars or people moving by during a section of time. In our miniproject, we will be more focus on interpreting the impact of the number of cars passing by on the number of wifi detected.
