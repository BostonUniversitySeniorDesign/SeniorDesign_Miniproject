# SeniorDesign wifi scan
Team: Wenjun and Henry


 Our team goal is to utilize the wifi scan function which accomplished by Raspberry Pi to detect the number of nearby moving or static hotspot.
 This goal is esaily achieved when we use wifi_scan.py to scan and log the data to a specific file which would be transfered into our laptop to be further interpret by wifi_plot.py.
